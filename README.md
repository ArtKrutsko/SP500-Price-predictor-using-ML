# SP500-Price-predictor-using-ML
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of machine learning models designed to predict S&P500 prices using historical data. The first part of the project involves building and comparing various algorithms in Python, leveraging the power of popular libraries including SKLearn, Tensorflow, and XGBoost.

The analysis includes a neural network featuring an LSTM layer, created with Tensorflow, and its performance is rigorously evaluated against other machine learning models such as Random Forest Classifier, Random Forest Regressor, and XGBRegressor.

To enhance the quality of predictions, I conducted data engineering tasks using Pandas Technical Analysis library for crafting insightful predictors. Additionally, the Random Forest models underwent an extensive hyperparameter tuning process to optimize their performance.
